# Desperado
A child-moral grooming website.
New project alert!!!
I present to you Desperado. A child-moral training website meant to tame and correct young kids (4-12years) who are thought by society to be naturally misbehaved.

Desperado is the online representation for the parent organisation Desperado. They use clear, refined and innovative methods that are unique to groom and train these kids. 

The four page site is halfway done. While two pages are done, I've still got two more to go. The colors were carefully picked to be visually friendly for kids and of course parents/guardians who will be visiting the site for thier ward's sake. The website has also has a login and register page for existing clients and new intakes respectively. 

Upcoming features in the site would include cookies, responsiveness for all screen sizes, and of course some hs functions to make the web more interactive. 

Please if you're seeing this, go through the project, throw in your thoughts and suggestion for areas of improvement. I'm always willing to listen. 
Thanks for your read.

P.S: Please run the code with a desktop as it is only compatible for desktop view for now.

Regards,
